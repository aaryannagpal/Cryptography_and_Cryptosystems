# Exploring_Cryptography

This repository is collection of my notes and codes while learning about cryptography. All the directories in this repository used to be a seperate repository on my profile, which I have now merged into this one. The notes are written in markdown and the codes are written in python, mostly on Jupyter Notebook.

## Crpytosystems covered here
* Elliptic Curve Cryptography
* RSA Cryptosystem
* ElGamal Cryptosystem
* One Time Pad
* Caesar Cipher
* Vigenere Cipher

**Note:** The codes are not optimized and are written for learning purposes only. They are not meant for production use.
